# Build Assets After Changes

Always run `npm run build` after making changes to CSS or HTML/Blade files that affect styling.

## When to Build

Run `npm run build` after changes to:

- Tailwind CSS classes in Blade templates
- `resources/css/app.css` file
- Any file that uses Tailwind utility classes
- `tailwind.config.js` configuration
- Adding or removing Tailwind plugins

## Build Commands

```bash
# Production build (minified, optimized)
npm run build

# Development build with watch mode
npm run dev
```

## Workflow

```bash
# 1. Make changes to Blade/CSS files
# 2. Build assets
npm run build

# 3. Verify changes in browser
# 4. Commit if everything looks good
git add .
git commit -m "Update styles"
```

## Important Notes

- The build process compiles Tailwind CSS and processes Vite assets
- Built assets are output to `public/build/`
- Development mode (`npm run dev`) watches for changes automatically
- Always build before committing frontend changes
- Production builds are optimized and purge unused CSS
